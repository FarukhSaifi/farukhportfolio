## Overview

CityPulseApp is a comprehensive React Native mobile application built with Expo SDK 53 for discovering and managing local events. The app features a clean, modular architecture with local storage persistence, making it fully functional offline. It demonstrates expertise in mobile development, API integration, state management, and internationalization.

## Key Features

- **Event Discovery**: Search and browse local events using Ticketmaster Discovery API v2
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup system with local user management
- **Favorites Management**: Save and organize favorite events with local persistence using AsyncStorage
- **Biometric Authentication**: Support for Face ID, Touch ID (iOS), and Fingerprint (Android)
- **Multi-language Support**: English and Arabic interface with full RTL layout support
- **Theme System**: Light and dark mode with dynamic switching
- **Offline Capability**: Full functionality without internet connection using AsyncStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and orientations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user-friendly alerts
- **Firebase Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for cloud backend integration

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 53
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (Stack + Bottom Tabs)
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage for data persistence
- **Internationalization**: i18n-js with expo-localization
- **UI Components**: Expo Vector Icons, LinearGradient
- **Maps**: React Native Maps integration
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated
- **API Integration**: Ticketmaster Discovery API v2

## Technical Highlights

- **Bridge Pattern Architecture**: Clean separation of business logic from UI components
- **Service Layer**: Modular API integration and data management
- **Intelligent Caching**: 5-minute cache duration for API responses
- **Retry Mechanism**: 3 attempts with 10-second timeout handling
- **Pagination Support**: Efficient handling of large event datasets
- **RTL Support**: Automatic layout direction handling for Arabic
- **Biometric Security**: Secure storage using device secure enclave
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling system with user feedback

## Architecture

The app follows a well-organized structure:

- **Bridge Pattern**: Business logic separated from UI components
- **Service Layer**: API integration and data management
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for components
- **Context Providers**: AppContext, ErrorContext, ThemeContext
- **Modular Components**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling
- **Utility Services**: Validation, error handling, and utility functions

## Key Screens

- **HomeScreen**: Main event discovery with search and filtering
- **EventDetailsScreen**: Comprehensive event information
- **FavoritesScreen**: Saved events management
- **ProfileScreen**: User profile with biometric settings
- **Login/Signup Screens**: Secure authentication flow
- **SplashScreen**: App loading and initialization

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Offline Functionality
**Problem**: Ensuring full app functionality without internet connection  
**Solution**: Implemented AsyncStorage for local persistence of user data, favorites, and preferences. Created intelligent caching system for API responses.

### Challenge 2: Multi-language Support
**Problem**: Supporting both English and Arabic with RTL layout  
**Solution**: Integrated i18n-js with expo-localization for dynamic language switching. Implemented automatic RTL layout direction handling.

### Challenge 3: API Rate Limiting
**Problem**: Managing Ticketmaster API rate limits and errors  
**Solution**: Implemented retry mechanism (3 attempts), timeout handling (10 seconds), and intelligent caching to minimize API calls.

### Challenge 4: State Management
**Problem**: Managing complex app state across multiple screens  
**Solution**: Used React Context API for global state management, avoiding prop drilling while keeping the architecture lightweight.

## Real-World Applications

This project demonstrates practical mobile development skills applicable to:

- **Event Management Platforms**: Similar apps for concerts, conferences, sports events
- **Location-Based Services**: Apps requiring geospatial data and maps
- **Offline-First Applications**: Apps that need to work without constant internet
- **Multi-language Apps**: International applications requiring localization
- **Biometric Security**: Apps requiring secure authentication

## Outcome

CityPulseApp successfully demonstrates:

- Proficiency in React Native and Expo development
- Understanding of mobile app architecture patterns
- API integration and data management skills
- Internationalization and localization expertise
- Offline-first development approach
- Security implementation (biometric authentication)
- User experience design for mobile platforms

The project showcases full-stack mobile development capabilities, from UI/UX design to backend integration, making it a comprehensive portfolio piece for mobile development roles.

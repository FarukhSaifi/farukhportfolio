## Overview

GitHub Finder is a dashboard application that leverages the GitHub API to provide users with a comprehensive view of GitHub profiles, repositories, and statistics. The application demonstrates proficiency in working with external APIs, state management using React Context API, and building modern, interactive user interfaces.

## Key Features

- **GitHub API Integration**: Seamless integration with GitHub's REST API
- **User Profile Display**: View detailed GitHub user profiles with statistics
- **Repository Browsing**: Browse and explore user repositories
- **Context API State Management**: Efficient state management without external libraries
- **Search Functionality**: Search for GitHub users by username
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all device sizes
- **Real-time Data**: Fetch and display live data from GitHub

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Context API
- **API Integration**: GitHub REST API
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API and Hooks

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented Context API for global state management, avoiding prop drilling
- Efficient API calls with proper error handling and loading states
- Clean component architecture with reusable components
- Responsive design ensuring great UX on mobile and desktop
- Optimized API usage to minimize rate limiting issues

## Challenges and Solutions

Working with the GitHub API required careful handling of rate limits and error states. I implemented proper error boundaries and loading states to provide a smooth user experience. The Context API implementation allowed for clean state management without the overhead of additional libraries like Redux.

## Outcome

The project demonstrates strong skills in API integration, state management, and building user-friendly interfaces. It showcases the ability to work with external APIs and create efficient, maintainable React applications.

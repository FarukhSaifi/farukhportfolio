## Overview

Misinformation Detector on Twitter is a Python-based algorithm designed to identify fake and misleading tweets by cross-referencing them with authenticated news sources. The project demonstrates expertise in natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and algorithmic problem-solving to combat misinformation on social media platforms.

## Key Features

- **News API Integration**: Authenticates tweets against Times of India news API for fact-checking
- **Keyword Matching**: Filters tweets based on contextual similarity with reference news articles
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines if tweets are negative or assertive using NLP techniques
- **XOR Logic**: Applies logical operations to detect contradictions between tweets and verified news
- **Configurable Similarity**: Adjustable `SimilarityDegreeValue` for keyword matching precision
- **Misinformation Detection**: Identifies tweets that contradict verified news sources

## How It Works

The algorithm follows a systematic approach to detect misinformation:

### Step 1: Contextual Filtering
- Filters tweets that are out of context by matching keywords with reference news
- Uses configurable `SimilarityDegreeValue` to determine relevance
- Ensures only relevant tweets are analyzed

### Step 2: Sentiment Analysis
- Applies NLP functions to detect negative operations in text
- Classifies tweets as either **Negative** or **Assertive**
- Uses pattern recognition to identify sentiment patterns

### Step 3: XOR Operation
- Performs XOR operation between tweet sentiment and news sentiment
- Binary classification: 0 for negative, 1 for positive
- Detects contradictions: If tweet (0) XOR news (1) = 1, the tweet contradicts the news

### Step 4: Misinformation Identification
- Flags tweets where XOR result is 1 (contradiction detected)
- Identifies false information that contradicts verified news sources
- Provides actionable results for fact-checking

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Natural language processing and text analysis
- **Pattern**: Advanced pattern matching and sentiment analysis
- **News API**: Times of India API for authenticated news sources
- **Twitter API**: For fetching and analyzing tweets

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented sophisticated NLP algorithms for text analysis
- Created configurable similarity matching system
- Developed XOR-based contradiction detection logic
- Integrated multiple APIs for comprehensive fact-checking
- Built scalable architecture for processing large volumes of tweets

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Contextual Relevance
**Problem**: Filtering relevant tweets from noise  
**Solution**: Implemented keyword matching with configurable similarity thresholds, allowing fine-tuned control over what constitutes relevant content.

### Challenge 2: Sentiment Classification
**Problem**: Accurately determining tweet sentiment  
**Solution**: Used NLTK and Pattern libraries for advanced sentiment analysis, detecting negative operations and classifying text accurately.

### Challenge 3: Contradiction Detection
**Problem**: Identifying when tweets contradict verified news  
**Solution**: Implemented XOR logic to mathematically detect contradictions between tweet sentiment and news sentiment.

## Real-World Applications

This project has practical applications in:

- **Social Media Monitoring**: Automated detection of misinformation on Twitter
- **Fact-Checking Services**: Supporting human fact-checkers with automated analysis
- **News Verification**: Cross-referencing social media claims with verified news sources
- **Research**: Academic research on misinformation patterns and detection methods

## Outcome

The Misinformation Detector successfully demonstrates:

- Proficiency in Python and NLP libraries (NLTK, Pattern)
- Understanding of sentiment analysis and text classification
- Ability to design algorithms for real-world problems
- Integration of multiple APIs and data sources
- Problem-solving skills in combating misinformation

This project showcases early expertise in natural language processing and algorithmic thinking, demonstrating the ability to tackle complex problems in the information verification space.
